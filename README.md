### P7: Design an A/B Test


#### DESCRIPTION: 

A/B tests are how data analysts determine whether one change causes another. Looking at historical data can only show that two changes are correlated. Correctly setting up and interperting A/B tests is a key skill for data analysts.

For the final project, the goal is to make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
